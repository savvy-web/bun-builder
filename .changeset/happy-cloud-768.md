Align with rslib-builder featureset: add multi-entry API model merging
with canonical reference rewriting, virtual entries for non-exported
bundles, format option for ESM/CJS output, forgottenExports control,
and TSDoc CI validation. Nest TSDoc lint config under apiModel.tsdoc.lint
and default apiModel to enabled.
